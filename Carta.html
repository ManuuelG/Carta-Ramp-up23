<h2>Re: Eileen Dover university application</h2>
<p>Dear Eileen,</p>     
<p>Thank you for your recent application to join us at the University of Awesome’s science faculty to study as part</p>
 of your PhD next year. I will answer your questions one by one, in the following sections.

</section>

<section>
    <h3>Starting dates</h3>
<p>We are happy to accomodate you starting your study with us at any time, however it would suit us better if you</p>
 could start at the beginning of a semester; the start dates for each one are as follows:
<ul>
<li>First semester: 9 September 2016</li>
<li>Second semester: 15 January 2017</li>
<li>Third semester 2 May 2017</li>

</ul>
<p>Please let me know if this is ok. and if so which start date you would prefer.</p>
You can find more information about important university dates on our website.

<section>
    <h3>Subjects of study</h3>
    <p>At the Awesome Science Faculty, we have a pretty open-minded research facility — as long as the subjects fall</p>
     <p>somewhere in the realm of science and technology. You seem like an intelligent, dedicated researcher, and just</p>
     <p>the kind of person we'd like to have on our team. Saying that, of the ideas you submitted we were most intrigued</p>
      by are as follows, in order of priority:
      <ol>
       <p><li>Turning H2O into wine, and the health benefits of Rcsveratrol (C14H12O3.)</li></p>
        <li><p>Measuring the effect on performance of funk bassplaycrs at tcmpraturcs exceeding 30°C (86°F), when the</p>
            <p>audience size exponentially increases (effect of 3 x 103 > 3 x 104.)</p> </li>
        <li><p>HTML and CSS constructs for representing musical scores.</p></li>
      </ol>
    
    <p>So please can you provide more information on each of these subjects, including how long you'd expect the </p>
     research to take, required staff and other resources, and anything else you think we'd need to know? Thanks.

    <h3>Exotic dance moves</h3>

    <p>Yes, you are right! As part of my post-doctorate work. I <i>did</i>> study exotic tribal dances. To answer your question,<br>
     my favourite dances are as follows, with definitions:</p>
    <p>Polynesian chicken dance</p>
    <p>A little known but <i>very</i> influential dance dating back as far as 300BC. a whole village would dance around<br>
    in a circle like chickens, to encourage their livestock or be "fruitful*.</p>
   <p> Icelandic brownian shuffle</p>
    <p>Before the Icelanders developed fire as a means of getting warm, they used to practice this dance, which<br>
     involved huddling close together in a circle on the floor, and shuffling their bodies around in imperceptably <br>
      tiny, very rapid movements. One of my fellow students used to say that he thought this dance inspired <br>
       modem styles such as Twerking. </p>
    <p>Arctic robot dance</p>
    <p>An interesting example of historic misinformation. English explorers in the 1960s believed to have <br>
     discovered a new dance style characterised by "robotic*, stilted movements, being practiced by inhabitants <br>
      of Northern Alaska and Canada. Later on however it was discovered that they were just moving like this <br>
       because they were really cold.</p>
